Agent: [Thinking...] (Type to interrupt)
Agent: I have evaluated the certificate **certificate.png** based on your criteria.

### **Extraction Results for certificate.png:**
*   **Student Name:** Ahmed Mahmoud Hossam Eldin Mahmoud Ibrahim
*   **University:** Cairo University
*   **Degree:** Bachelor of Petroleum & Petrochemical Eng. (Credit Hours System)
*   **GPA:** 3.490
*   **Graduation Date:** January 2015

### **Evaluation Against Criteria:**
*   **Required Degree:** Computer Science
*   **Minimum GPA:** 3.7

**Final Result: FAIL**

**Reasons:**
1.  **GPA Requirement:** The student's GPA of **3.49** is below the required **3.7**.
2.  **Degree Requirement:** The degree is in **Petroleum & Petrochemical Engineering**, which does not match the required **Computer Science** degree.

I also see you provided **Bachelor's Final Transcript.pdf**. Would you like me to evaluate that one as well?
User: Wait, what if we require a 3.4 GPA instead, and the degree must be any engineering degree?
Agent: [Thinking...] (Type to interrupt)
Agent: I have re-evaluated **certificate.png** with the updated criteria.

### **Updated Evaluation for certificate.png:**
*   **Required Degree:** Any engineering degree
*   **Minimum GPA:** 3.4

**Final Result: PASS**

**Reasons:**
1.  **GPA Requirement:** The student's GPA of **3.49** meets the minimum requirement of **3.4**.
2.  **Degree Requirement:** The degree **"Bachelor of Petroleum & Petrochemical Eng."** is an engineering degree, so it meets the requirement.

Would you like me to proceed with evaluating the other file, **Bachelor's Final Transcript.pdf**, using these same criteria?
User: Okay, keep it at 3.7 and evaluate both Certificates                
Agent: [Thinking...] (Type to interrupt)
Interrupt: make it 3.8 not 3.7
